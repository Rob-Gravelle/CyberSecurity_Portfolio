# 🔐 Cybersecurity Portfolio – Robert Gravelle

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio.
This repository is a work-in-progress showcase of hands-on security projects,
learning labs, detection tooling, and cryptography experiments built primarily
with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

Current date: January 2026

ABOUT ME

Cybersecurity analyst with a strong focus on defensive security
(Blue Team) fundamentals.

Primary interests include:
- Threat detection and monitoring
- Network traffic analysis
- Credential and password security
- Phishing and social engineering defense
- Practical cryptography (implementation + research)

This portfolio emphasizes real, executable projects rather than theory alone.

ACTIVE PROJECTS (JANUARY 2026)

Notebook-Based Projects:
- Password Strength Analyzer
- Packet Analyzer
- Intrusion Detection Prototype
- Phishing Detection Prototype

Cryptography Projects:
- AES CBC Encryptor
- AES Algorithm Simulator
- Lorenz Cipher Implementation
- Password Hashing Benchmarks
- RSA From Scratch (Keygen, Encrypt, Decrypt)

Each project includes working code and documentation
explaining design choices and security concepts.

--------------------------------------------------

CRYPTOGRAPHY FOCUS

The cryptography section emphasizes:
- Implementing algorithms from first principles
- Understanding operational weaknesses and misuse
- Comparing modern and historical encryption systems
- Evaluating password hashing performance and tradeoffs

Projects are designed for learning, analysis, and demonstration
—not production deployment.

--------------------------------------------------

ROADMAP

Planned next steps:
- Refine documentation and visuals
- Extract reusable crypto and detection utilities
- Expand cryptographic research (modes, padding, attacks)
- Structured CTF write-ups
- Add ethical red-team simulations with clear scope

--------------------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER

All projects are for educational and research purposes only.
No real credentials, sensitive data, or unauthorized systems are used.
