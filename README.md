Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Portfolio**.  
This repository is a work-in-progress showcase of hands-on security projects, learning labs, detection tooling, and security experiments built primarily with **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

**Current date:** January 2026

## 🧠 About Me

Cybersecurity analyst with a strong focus on **defensive security (Blue Team)** fundamentals.

Key interests include:
- Threat detection & monitoring  
- Network traffic analysis  
- Credential & password security  
- Phishing and social engineering defense  
- Practical cryptography (implementation + research)

This portfolio documents some of my projects through real, executable projects rather than theory alone.

## 🛤️ Roadmap & Next Steps

Planned improvements and expansions:

- Refine and polish existing notebooks  
  - Clearer visualizations  
  - Improved explanations and conclusions  
- Extract reusable logic into standalone scripts (`tools-scripts/`)
- Begin cryptography-focused projects:
  - AES and RSA implementations
  - Hashing and password cracking fundamentals
- Start CTF write-ups and home-lab detection exercises
- Add first ethical **red team** project with clear legal boundaries
